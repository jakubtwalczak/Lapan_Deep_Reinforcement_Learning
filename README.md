# Lapan_Deep_Reinforcement_Learning

Repository with a code from the book "Deep Reinforcement Learning" written by M. Lapan.

Each notebook contains the code listings from each of the book chapters'. **Attention**: because of the fact that the Gym library hasn't been developed since 2021, the entire code of the repository uses the Gymnasium library for demonstration.
